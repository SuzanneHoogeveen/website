  abstract = {Compensatory Control Theory (CCT) suggests that religious belief systems provide an external source of control that can substitute a perceived lack of personal control. In a seminal paper, it was experimentally demonstrated that a threat to personal control increases endorsement of the existence of a controlling God. In the current registered report, we conducted a high-powered (N = 829) direct replication of this effect, using samples from the Netherlands and the United States (US). Our results show moderate to strong evidence for the absence of an experimental effect across both countries: belief in a controlling God did not increase after a threat compared to an affirmation of personal control. In a complementary preregistered analysis, an inverse relation between general feelings of personal control and belief in a controlling God was found in the US, but not in the Netherlands. We discuss potential reasons for the replication failure of the experimental effect and cultural mechanisms explaining the cross-country difference in the correlational effect. Together, our findings suggest that experimental manipulations of control may be ineffective in shifting belief in God, but that individual differences in the experience of control may be related to religious beliefs in a way that is consistent with CCT.},

Here, we assess the extent to which a finding?s replication success relates to its intuitive plausibility. Each of 27 high-profile social-science findings was evaluated by 233 people without a Ph.D. in psychology. Results showed that these laypeople predicted replication success with above-chance accuracy (i.e., 59\%). In addition, when participants were informed about the strength of evidence from the original studies, this boosted their prediction performance to 67\%. We discuss the prediction patterns and apply signal detection theory to disentangle detection ability from response bias. Our study suggests that laypeople?s predictions contain useful information for assessing the probability that a given finding will be replicated successfully.},

Participants (N=193) performed a gender-Stroop task and afterwards completed standardized measures to assess their religiosity. As expected, the task induced cognitive conflict at the behavioral level and at a neural level this was reflected in increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, individual differences in religiosity were not related to performance on the Stroop task as measured in accuracy and interference effects, nor to neural markers of response conflict (correct responses vs. errors) or informational conflict (congruent vs. incongruent stimuli). Overall, we obtained moderate to strong evidence in favor of the null hypotheses that religiosity is unrelated to cognitive conflict sensitivity. We discuss the implications for the neuroscience of religion and emphasize the importance of designing studies that more directly implicate religious concepts and behaviors in an ecologically valid manner.},

The Many Labs 4 project recently failed to replicate the mortality salience effect where being reminded of one's own death strengthens the own cultural identity. Here, we provide a Bayesian reanalysis of Many Labs 4 using meta-analytic and hierarchical modeling approaches and model comparison with Bayes factors. In a multiverse analysis we assess the robustness of the results with varying data inclusion criteria and prior settings. Bayesian model comparison results largely converge to a common conclusion: We find evidence against a mortality salience effect across the majority of our analyses. Even when ignoring the Bayesian model comparison results we estimate overall effect sizes so small (between d = 0.03 and d = 0.18) that it renders the entire field of mortality salience studies as uninformative.},

  abstract = {When experiencing personal distress, people usually expect their romantic partner to be supportive. However, when put in a situation to provide support, people may at times (still) be struggling with issues of their own. This interdependent nature of dyadic coping interactions as well as potential spillover effects is mirrored in the state-of-the-art research method to behaviorally assess couple's dyadic coping processes. This paradigm typically includes two videotaped 8-min dyadic coping conversations in which partners swap roles as sharer and support provider. Little is known about how such dyadic coping interactions may feed back into one another, impacting the motivation and ability to be a responsive support provider. In three behavioral studies, we examined how sharers' experiences may spill over to affect their own support provision in a subsequent dyadic coping interaction. We hypothesized that the extent to which sharers perceive their partner as responsive to their self-disclosure increases the quality of their own subsequent support provision (Hypothesis 1), whereas sharers' lingering negative affect reduces the quality of their own subsequent support provision (Hypothesis 2). In line with our first hypothesis, perceived partner responsiveness predicted the provision of higher-quality support, though primarily as perceived by the partner. Sharers who perceived their partner to have been more responsive were somewhat more likely to subsequently engage in positive dyadic coping and were rated as more responsive by their partners. Negative dyadic coping behavior was unaffected. Evidence for our second hypothesis was mixed. While lingering negative affect did not affect positive dyadic coping behavior or perceived support, it did increase the chances of negative dyadic coping behavior. However, given the very low occurrences of negative affect and negative dyadic coping, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Taken together, these findings suggest that support interactions may feed back into one another, highlighting the complex and interdependent nature of dyadic coping. The strongest and most consistent findings concerned the spillover effect of perceived partner responsiveness on subsequent perceived support quality, speaking to the key role of believing that one's partner is responsive to one's needs in promoting healthy relationship functioning.},

Using a single-blind experimental design, participants (N\,=\,57) were attached to a transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) device, and in different blocks, they were verbally instructed to expect enhanced or impaired cognitive performance, or no effects of the brain stimulation. In all cases, but unbeknownst to the participants, we used an inert sham tDCS protocol. Subsequently, we measured their response to errors on a cognitive control task. Our expectancy manipulation was successful: participants reported improved subjective performance in the enhancement compared with the impairment condition\textemdash even though objective performance was kept at a constant level across conditions. Participants reported the highest feelings of agency over their task performance in the control condition, and lowest feelings of agency in the impairment condition. The expectancy manipulation did not affect the error-related negativity (ERN) in association with incorrect responses. During the induction phase, expecting impaired versus enhanced performance increased frontal theta power, potentially reflecting a process of increased cognitive control allocation. Our findings show that verbally induced manipulations can affect subjective performance on a cognitive control task, but that stronger manipulations (e.g., through conditioning) are necessary to induce top-down effects on neural error processing.},
